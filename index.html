      <h4>THE KITTIES TO GO STORY</h4>
      <p>Fall asleep on the washing machine snuggles up to shoulders or knees and
        purrs you to sleep. Eat prawns daintly with a claw then lick paws clean
        wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then <a href="#">retire to the warmest spot</a>
        on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap attempt to leap
        between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor;
        what's your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently
        cough and swat at dog.</p>
      <p>Fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) fooled again thinking the
        dog likes me. Jump launch to pounce upon little yarm mouse, bare fangs
        at toy run hid in litter box until treats are fed hiss at vacuum cleaner
        and always hungry for lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep stretch.</p>
